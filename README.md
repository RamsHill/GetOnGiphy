# GetOnGiphy
An unofficial API to GET json gif references from https://giphy.com.

This API only do GET requests because GET is the only point of "GetOn project".

This is also the fist ASP.NET Core application that I've ever made.

## How to

Just access and you gonna be redirected to Swagger page with all the API documentation.

## References

This project is based on a console application tutorial made by an unknown author.
